          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I am a senior front end web developer with 20 years of experience
            turning visual designs into accessible, responsive, compliant
            digital interfaces. I have done UX/UI design in Figma and Adobe XD.
          </p>
          <p>
            My core competencies center around HTML, CSS, and JavaScript having
            a background in developing WordPress and Drupal themes. I am
            continuously improving and becoming more proficient in React
            leveraging TypeScript and Unit Testing. I have built a few projects
            in Angular and look forward to learning more in that framework. I
            have been making connections to REST APIs from front end
            applications accessing data in JSON and XML format. My familiarity
            with back end technologies has been thanks to projects utilizing
            MySQL connections from PHP and also Node with Express applications.
            MongoDB and mongoose have played a role in a number of side projects
            exploring the MERN stack.
          </p>
          <p>
            I thrive working with other developers and sharing knowledge. My
            career has had me collaborating remotely using MS Teams and Zoom,
            organizing and following Agile workflows in Jira and Basecamp,
            meeting across a table in person and operating independently as a
            project lead or contributor.

          {/*<p>I love music. My kids got me into bluegrass when they were young.&nbsp; I found that I had gravitated to wanting to learn the banjo and was obsessed with getting one for a few years. I finally did and with the help of a ton of YouTube watching, taking notes, and hours of practice I managed to learn some songs and am continuing to make steady progress. Learning to play banjo has given me endless joy.</p>
<p>One of my ultimate favorite songs - "Can't Get There From Here" by R.E.M. has a verse that says, "If you're needing inspiration, Philomath is where I go". Philomath is a town in Georgia I've never yet been to but I appreciate the notion of finding my way through the world and learning as many new things as I can.</p> */}
